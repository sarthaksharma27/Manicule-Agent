# File Upload API

## Overview

The File Upload API allows clients to upload files to the server. This document outlines the usage of the `/upload/v2` endpoint, which supersedes the previous `/upload` endpoint.

## Endpoint

### POST `/upload/v2`

This endpoint accepts a single file upload. The file must be sent as a form-data request with the key `file`.

### Request

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/upload/v2`
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`

#### Parameters

<ParamField name="file" type="file" required={true}>
The file to be uploaded. Must be included in the form-data with the key `file`.
</ParamField>

### Response

- **Status Code**: `200 OK` if the file is successfully received.
- **Status Code**: `400 Bad Request` if no file is uploaded.

#### JSON Response Example

```json
{
  "message": "File received"
}
```

### Error Handling

- If no file is uploaded, the server will respond with a `400 Bad Request` status and the message "No file uploaded".

## Usage Example

To upload a file, send a `POST` request to `/upload/v2` with the file included in the form-data. Below is an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://yourserver.com/upload/v2 \
  -F "file=@/path/to/yourfile.txt"
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the file size and type are within the server's accepted limits.
- The server logs the original name of the received file for reference.
