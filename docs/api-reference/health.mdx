# Manicule Agent API

This document provides an overview of the API routes available in the Manicule Agent backend. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with TypeScript for type safety.

## Getting Started

To start the backend server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on the default port 4000.

## API Routes

### Health Check

The health check endpoint is used to verify that the server is running.

- **URL**: `/health`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: `200 OK`

### File Upload

The upload endpoint allows users to upload files to the server.

- **URL**: `/upload`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Response**: `201 Created`

### Media

The media endpoint has been added to handle media-related requests.

- **URL**: `/media`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: `200 OK`

<ParamField path="/media" type="GET">Retrieve media resources</ParamField>

## Development Setup

Ensure you have Node.js version 18.12 or higher installed. The project uses TypeScript, so you will need to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server with `nodemon` and `ts-node`.
- **`npm run build`**: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript.
- **`npm start`**: Runs the compiled JavaScript files.

## Dependencies

The project relies on several key dependencies:

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used for file uploads.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## TypeScript Configuration

The TypeScript configuration is set to target ES2017 and includes libraries for DOM and ESNext. The configuration ensures strict type checking and module resolution.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2017",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "strict": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  }
}
```
