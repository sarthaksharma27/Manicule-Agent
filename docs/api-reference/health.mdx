  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.txt"
```

### Node.js

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
import FormData from 'form-data';
import fs from 'fs';

const form = new FormData();
form.append('file', fs.createReadStream('/path/to/your/file.txt'));

axios.post('http://localhost:4000/upload/v2', form, {
  headers: {
    ...form.getHeaders(),
  },
})
.then(response => {
  console.log(response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error(error.response.data);
});
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the file is included in the form data with the key `file`.
- The server logs the original name of the uploaded file for reference.
